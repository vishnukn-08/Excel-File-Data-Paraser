To run the app, in the project directory you can run:

### `npm start`.

How the app work: 
- There is an upload button which allows you to select file from the local machine.
- Once you upload an excel file, the data will parsed and displayed as JSON in the field.
- There will be two buttons present below the field, one is to `Save` which will send the JSON to server side API(currently mocked) and `Copy to Clipboard` which can be used to copy the entire JSON.
